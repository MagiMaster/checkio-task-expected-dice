    For this task, you'll be playing some board games.
    Or rather, you're going to be, but first you'd like to know more about the probabilities involved.
</p>

<p>
    Many board games fall under the category of "roll and move" games.
    In these games, you roll some dice and move that many spaces forward.
    In some games, you then move forward or backwards a number of spaces depending on which space you landed on.
</p>

<p>
    You want to work out, given a description of the board and the dice used,
    what the expected number of moves would be to reach a target square.
    For this task, all the boards under consideration are circular and when moving off one end you simply continue from
    the other.
    A board is represented as a list of integers. Each cell number means
    how many cells to move (positive for forward, negative for backwards) after landing on that cell.
    You always start from the first cell (index 0) and
    the starting and target squares will not require any further movement after landing on them.
</p>

<p>
    For example. If we have one 4-sided die, the simple board [0,0,0,0] and any target square,
    then you have a 1/4 chance of reaching the target on every roll, so on average it will take 4 rolls.
    The result should be given with one digit precision as &plusmn;0.1.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong>
    A number of dice to roll as an integer,
    the number of sides on each die as an integer,
    a target space as an integer and a board as a list of integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong>
    The expected number of moves needed to reach the target space starting from space 0,
    correct to 1 digit after the decimal place. If it takes 33 1/3 moves, you should return 33.3.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Example:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">
checkio(1, 4, 3, [0, 0, 0, 0]) == 4.0   # On these first three, you have a 1/4 chance of reaching the target
checkio(1, 4, 1, [0, 0, 0, 0]) == 4.0   # on every roll, so on average it will take 4 rolls.
checkio(1, 4, 3, [0, -1, -2, 0]) == 4.0 
checkio(1, 4, 3, [0, 2, 1, 0]) == 1.3   # You have a 3/4 chance of reaching the exit and 1/4 chance of ending up where you started
checkio(1, 6, 1, [0] * 10) == 8.6
checkio(2, 6, 1, [0] * 10) == 10.2
